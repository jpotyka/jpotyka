###  [scheduler](https://github.com/DigonIO/scheduler)

A simple in-process python scheduler library with timezone and threading support. Schedule tasks by their time cycles, fixed times, weekdays, dates, weights, offsets and execution counts and automate Jobs.

###  [imgreg](https://github.com/DigonIO/imgreg)
