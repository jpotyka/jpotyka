###  [scheduler](https://github.com/DigonIO/scheduler)

A simple in-process python scheduler library with timezone and threading support. Schedule tasks by their time cycles, fixed times, weekdays, dates, weights, offsets and execution counts and automate Jobs.

###  [imgreg](https://github.com/DigonIO/imgreg)

An image registration library for python including a simple interface for building new models. Currently two image registration models for linear transformations based on scikit have been implemented as part of a toolchain in the context of particle image velocimetry (PIV). Tested for Python 3.7 to Python 3.9.
